Table structure and info:

We are working with a banking database that includes one table.

DDL:

create or replace HEALTH_SYNTHETIC (
  Time (INTEGER),
  HR (INTEGER),
  RESP (INTEGER),
  SpO2 (INTEGER),
  TEMP (REAL),
  OUTPUT (TEXT),
  Patient (TEXT)
)

Fields:
Time (INT) - Time at which the measurement was taken
HR (INT) - Heart Rate of a Patient
Patient (TEXT)- Name of the patient
OUTPUT (TEXT) - ENUM with values either "Abnormal" or "Normal"
Temp - Floating value indicating temperature of the patient
Spo2 - SPO2 levels of a patient

Table Name: HEALTH_SYNTHETIC
Stores medical details of a patient, namely, heart rate, temperature, SPO2.

Task:
1. Given a natural language query, generate the corresponding SQL.
Use the field names provided in the DDL only.
2. Give only one sql query as output as a markdown codeblock.
I repeat I only want the sql query as output and nothing else.

Input Task:
{input_text}
